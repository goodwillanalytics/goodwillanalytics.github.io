            <h2 class="title text-center">Why?</h2>
			<p class="intro text-center">The idea originated from the DataKind events held around the world. And there are similarly styled weekend events for other causes held in Sydney all the time. So the idea is to bring these data events here to assist local not-for-profits realise more benefits from their data.</p>
			<p class="intro text-center">Many NFPs (not-for-profits) gather lots of data over time, however, depending on their size, they don't have the skills or funding to maximise the use of analytics to help them solve their problems. They collect lots of data but donâ€™t know what to do with it, and how to get the best out of it.</p>
			<p class="intro text-center">The event is run over a weekend and a collective of skilled volunteers (data analysts, scientists, engineers and designers) will work in teams to solve a key problem for a not-for-profit.</p>
