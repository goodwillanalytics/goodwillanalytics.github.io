            <h2 class="title">Why?</h2>
			<p class="intro text-center">The idea originated from the DataKind events held around the world with first hand experience from one of our members. Now we would like to bring a similar event here to assist local not-for-profits release the potential of their data.</p>
			<p class="intro text-center">Many NPOs gather lots of operational data over time, however depending on their size they may not have the skills or funding to use analytics to help them solve their problems. They collect lots of data but often they donâ€™t know what to do with it.</p>
			<p class="intro text-center">The event is run over a weekend and a collective of skilled volunteers (data analysts, scientists, engineers and designers) will work in teams to solve a key problem for a not-for-profit.</p>
