			<p class="intro text-center">The idea originated from the DataKind events held around the world. Captain Alvin, the event chief, attended one such event in the UK and was so taken by the idea that he wanted to replicate the concept here in Sydney.</p>

			<p class="intro text-center">Many NFPs (not-for-profits) gather lots of data over time, however depending on their size, they don't have the skills or funding to maximise the use of analytics to help them solve their problems. They collect lots of data but donâ€™t know what to do with it, and how to get the best out of it.</p>
