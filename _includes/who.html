			<h3 class="title text-center">Social Cause Organisation</h3>
			<div class="features-inner">	
				<p>The volunteers may have the superpowers, but the social cause organisations are the heart of our endeavours.</p>
				<p>Social causes are dedicated to improving the lives of others and making a difference - from supporting underprivileged individuals and communities, to aiding research to find cures for life-threatening illnesses, to fighting for animal rights.</p>
				<p>We’re all familiar with the causes, but often we don’t quite know how to help.</p>
				<p>Prior to the Goodwill Analytics event, the social causes will identify a number of key problems. The biggest ticket problems, with relevant supporting data, will be selected to be tackled at the event.</p>
				<p>If you are a social cause organisation and are interested in participating in a Goodwill Analytics event then reach out to us at <a href="mailto:goodwillanalytics2016@gmail.com">goodwillanalytics2016@gmail.com</a>.</p>

			<h3 class="title text-center">Data Ambassadors</h3>
			<div class="features-inner">
				<p>The leaders at the forefront of the event.</p>
				<p>Our Data Ambassadors are data professionals just like the rest of the volunteers, but they have the chance to collaborate more closely with their social cause.</p>
				<p>The Ambassadors will meet up with their social cause prior to the event to gather data and work with them to identify those big-ticket problems.</p>
				<p>Before the event, they will also have done some preparation for the way their social cause's problems could be solved and will guide their team of data volunteers in the right direction, helping to drive optimal outcomes and collect results.</p>
				<p>If you are interested in being a Data Ambassador at a Goodwill Analytics event you can hit us up at <a href="mailto:goodwillanalytics2016@gmail.com">goodwillanalytics2016@gmail.com</a>.</p>

			<h3 class="title text-center">Volunteer Data Professionals</h3>
			<div class="features-inner">
				<p>The superheroes of the event.</p>
				<p>The number crunchers extraordinaire. The pattern spotters. The abstract and out-of-box thinkers. The ones with the superpowers, who wear capes, and their underpants on the outside, just our Captain Alvin.</p>
				<p>After hearing about what each social cause supports and the problems they face, you will choose which cause you would like to work on for the weekend.</p>
				<p>You will form small teams and, after a brief exchange of pleasantries and perhaps a humble brag, you’ll knuckle down and lend your skills for a worthy cause!</p>
