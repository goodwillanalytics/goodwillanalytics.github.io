			<h2 class="title text-center">Who?</h2>
			<h3 class="sub-title text-center">Not-For-Profits Organisations</h3>
			<div class="license-inner">	
				<p>NFPs and the causes they represent are at the heart of these endeavours.</p>
				<p>NFPs dedicate all of their time and profits to aiding their cause: from supporting underprivileged individuals and communities, to aiding research to find cures for life-threatening diseases, to fighting for animal rights and campaigning to preserve the pristine areas of our planet.</p>
				<p>We’re all familiar with the causes, but often we don’t quite know how to help.</p>
				<p>Prior to Goodwill Analytics weekend event, the participating NFPs will identify a number of problems that they are facing. The biggest ticket problems with relevant data will then be selected to be addressed during the weekend event.
				<p>At the beginning of the event, the organizations will present:
					<ul class="feature-list list-unstyled">
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> their cause,</li>
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> the chosen problems, and</li>
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> the data available to solve the problem.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

			<h4 class="sub-title text-center">Hello Sunday Morning</h4>
			<!--<div class="license-inner">-->
				<p><b>Cause</b></p>
				<p>HSM is a movement towards a better drinking culture. They have a community platform for people taking an alcohol break and an iPhone app for those interested in alcohol moderation.</p>
				<p><b>Opportunities</b>
					<ul class="feature-list list-unstyled">
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> A model for what works - what are the things that lead to reduction in risk.</li>
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> They currently use an academic measure of risk reduction. What does the future measure of program effectiveness look like? Looking into measuring collaboration and/or sentiment analysis of blog posts etc.</li>
				</p>
			<!--</div>-->
			<br/>
			<h4 class="sub-title text-center">Refugee Council of Australia (RCOA)</h4>
			<!--<div class="license-inner">-->
				<p><b>Cause</b></p>
				<p>The national umbrella body for refugees and the organisations and individuals who support them including 200 organisational and 900+ individual members. RCOA’s own work is centred around five key areas: policy, support for refugees, support for its members, community education and administration.</p>
				<p><b>Opportunities</b>
					<ul class="feature-list list-unstyled">
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> How to better structure their current database/CRM pipeline.</li>
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Create automated reporting for their donor base.</li>
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Generate and automate an RFM segmentation.</li>
				</p>

			<br/>
			<h4 class="sub-title text-center">Shepherd Centre</h4>
			<!--<div class="license-inner">-->
				<p><b>Cause</b></p>
				<p>A medium sized organisation which helps children who are hearing impaired from birth up until they start school. Their programs include providing hearing implants, education for parents on how to teach and interact their children over several years.</p>
				<p><b>Opportunities</b>
					<ul class="feature-list list-unstyled">
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Build better segmentations. Demographic/Attitudinal segmentation overlaid with a (better) RFM segmentation.</li>
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Determine donor segmentation and best messaging per segment.</li>
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Clinical Predictions - is it possible to predict the trajectory/progress of a child from some of the earlier tests? And then better tailor programs to achieve the best outcome for each child.</li>

			<h3 class="sub-title text-center">Data Ambassadors</h3>
			<div class="license-inner">
				<p>The leaders at the forefront of the event.</p>
				<p>Our Data Ambassadors are data professionals just like the rest of the volunteers, but will have the chance to work more closely with their designated NFP. The Ambassadors will meet up with their NFP prior to the event to gather data and collaborate with them to identify those big-ticket problems. Before the commencement of the weekend, they will also have done some initial thinking about the way in which the problem could be solved and will guide their team of data volunteers in the right direction, helping to drive optimal outcomes and collect results.</p>
			</div>
			<h3 class="sub-title text-center">Volunteer Data Professionals</h3>
			<div class="license-inner">
				<p>The stars of the events. The number crunchers extraordinaire. The abstract and out-of-box thinkers. The pattern spotters. The insight finders. YOU!</p>
				<p>After hearing about the causes each NFP represents, learning about the problems they are trying to solve and seeing the data they have to work with, you will be able to choose which cause you want to support for the weekend.</p>
				<p>You will form teams with other like-minded individuals from such disciplines as data analysis, data science and software engineering, and you will get to apply your skills for a worthy cause.</p>
