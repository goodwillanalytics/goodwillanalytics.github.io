			<h3 class="sub-title text-center">Not-For-Profits</h3>
			<div class="license-inner">	
				<p>These are the good causes of the event.</p>
				<p>They are organisations that are set up to put all profits into furthering their cause. They support under privileged people and communities. They help research diseases we want cures for. They fight for animal rights. They campaign for preserving the pristine nature areas of the planet.</p>
				<p>Prior to the event the Not-For-Profits will identify a number of problems they are facing. Then a high-level assessment will be done to see which of the problems they have the data to further investigate and get some answers for. The biggest ticket problem with relevant data will be chosen for the event.</p>
				<p>At the start of the event the organisations will present:
					<ul class="feature-list list-unstyled">
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> their cause, and</li>
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> the chosen problem, and</li>
						<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> the data they have brought to solve the problem.</li>
					</ul>

			<div class="license-inner">
				<p>The stars of the events. The number crunchers extraordinaire. The abstract and out-of-box thinkers. The pattern spotters. The insight finders.</p>
				<p>After hearing the causes, the problems they are trying to solve and the data they have to work with you will be able to choose which cause you want to support for the weekend.</p>
				<p>You will form teams with other like-minded individuals from the disciplines of data analysis, data science, software engineering, etc. and get to work on the problems the Not-For-Profit is trying to resolve.</p>

				<p><b>Place2Be</b><br>Is the leading children's mental health charity in the UK providing customized in-school support and expert training to improve the emotional wellbeing of pupils, families, teachers and school staff.</p>
				<p>They attended the event to show that their support programs achieved positive results but did not have the data analytics capabilities in-house to quantify the results.</p>
				<p>The outcome of the event for Place2Be was:</p>
				<ul class="feature-list list-unstyled">
					<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> The value of the support program was proven (after adjusting for bias in the reporting methods)</li>
					<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Insight was gained to guide future focus areas, Place2Be learned that:
						<ul class="list-unstyled">
							<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Boys generally performed better</li>
							<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Girls with single fathers improved the most</li>
							<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Their method of capturing data (i.e. self-assessment surveys) added noticeable bias to the reporting process and needed change</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Place2Be was so excited by the efforts of the volunteers and the quantified positive results of the program that they invited their largest sponsor to see the presentation firsthand.</li>

				<p><b>GiveDirectly</b><br>Is an innovative nonprofit that provides financial support to the poorest households in rural Kenya and Uganda. They provide the money with no strings attached. Recipients are free to use the money to pursue their own goals.</p>
				<p>They targets the poorest of the poor and has found that a simple yet effective proxy for poverty. In national survey data they found that the housing materials a family uses for its home has a strong correlation to poverty levels. In this part of the world, many families invest available cash in a metal roof, which lasts for years. Those who canâ€™t afford metal sheets make do with thatch roofs which leak and need frequent repair.</p>
				<p>Using Google Maps satellite imagery GiveDirectly could see images of the roofs used in a particular village. This provides great insight, however creating some useful information from the many images across both countries was going to be a time consuming process.</p>
				<p>Prior to the event the GiveDirectly Data Ambassadors created an image processing and machine learning algorithm that would estimate, based  on an image of the house, whether it has a thatch or metal roof.</p>
				<p>They used the event to teach the algorithm, the volunteers helped label nearly 1,500 images.The algorithm identified individual homes in an image using template matching and was able to identify the color threshold that classified them as thatch or metal.</p>
				<p>Calculating the proportion of thatch to metal roofed homes in a village meant GiveDirectly was much better able to target the communities most in need, and had a way to adjust their areas of focus over time as the donations had effect.</p>
